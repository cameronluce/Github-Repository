    "* For questions that require a written component please use 'Markdown' and type your answer in the cell.\n",

    "* Hint 1 - when you write functions etc. it is always good practice to write a step-by-step list or pseudocode at the top of you function which explains the steps you intend your code to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint 2 - Good code is general - do your codes work for any size/shape array - would it provide useful 'error messages' to the user? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint 3 - You may of course ask questions to me, we will have two lessons where you can work in the class on coureswork. This may not look too difficult but IT IS NOT an EASY coursework - consider planning for questions 4 and 5 on a sheet of paper first and always try testing your code with small arrays first so things don't take forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint 4 - Do not leave it until the last moment - you will need 'doing' time and 'thinking' time for especially questions 4 and 5 so you will need several days to reflect on your approaches!\n",

    "* Hint 5 - Finish all the notebooks! They will help you!"
