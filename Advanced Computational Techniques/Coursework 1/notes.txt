- make sure to comment on everything, shows you understand what your code is doing and how/why
- always ask questions if you're stuck

- not using any libraries unless explicitly stated
- pseudocode is required for every main program AND function - examples in notebook 2
- functions should be written with split declaration at the top (before MAIN) and definition at the bottom (below MAIN)
- use a 'python style' form of indentation in your code (it's not necessary in C but is good practice as code is more readable)

if you have a bug check the following:
- always import stdio.h
- caes sensitive
- semicolons, put them everywhere!
- double and single quotes are different
- define everything
